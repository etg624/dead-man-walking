## Built in a week with Python3.7 and PYGAME 
- I built this game with no prior Python experience to show case my abilty to learn new thing quickly.
- Also built with the help and guidence of **Chris Angelico** aka **Rosuav**.

### Locally Playing the game.

Unfortunately PYGAME isn't very good at distrbution. Even creating an exe file is a big headache. 


- Make sure you have python3 [installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Clone this repo and cd into it.
- run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- after everything is installed run `python3 game.py` and the game should start
- Also there is an issue where the *FPS* and the *font size* changes on different machines. 
- `FPS` can be found at the top of the game.py file and you can adjust accordingly. 
  - The higher the number the faster the game. 
``` 
draw_text(screen, "How long can you survive until you are...", 20, WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 1.65)
``` 
- the first number `20` in this case is the font size. 
 - Adjust it to how you see fit!
